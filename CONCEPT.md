2D arena shooter, played through simple P2P networking.

Players control a robot with a gun arm, moved around with A and D (left and right), jumping with space. Gun arm aims towards cursor position on screen. Left mouse to fire.

First player to be the last standing 3 times wins. Every round players are prompted to select one of three powerups. Powerups shouldn't be boring stuff like stat boosts, but hectic, fun changes in gameplay. Players can hold up to three powerups before they have to replace one to get a new powerup.

**Planned development time:** 2-3 weeks (1 week of warmup because I haven't made a game in a year at this point)
