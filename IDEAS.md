# Powerup ideas
- **Explosive Blast:** Every third shot becomes explosive, dealing damage in a radius when it hits another robot or terrain.
- **Ricochet Blast:** Every third shot contains three of the original shot that would be fired, with all effects applied. When it hits another robot or terrain, it explodes and releases all of the stored shots in random directions.
- **Laser Focus:** Every shot becomes a laser, instantly dealing damage to robots in its path. Cannot combine with other modifiers.
